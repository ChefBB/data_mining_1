Different regression techniques were applied to the dataset, testing
on different combinations of attributes. The target variable chosen for
Univariate and Multiple regression was \texttt{criticReviewsTotal}, while
for Multivariate regression, the target variables were both
\texttt{userReviewsTotal} and \texttt{criticReviewsTotal}.


\section{Univariate and Multiple Regression}
For Univariate Regression, the attribute
\texttt{criticReviewsTotal} was chosen
as the target variable. This choice was made because it has a high correlation
with the attribute \texttt{userReviewsTotal}, allowing univariate regression
to be performed, while maintaining a clear separate semantic meaning.
For Multiple Regression, the target variable was kept the same, in order to
allow for a direct comparison of the results obtained with the two techniques.
The feature also has an important semantic meaning, strictly related to the
engagement towards the product, which links this analysis to the binary
classification performed in section~\ref{sec:binary_classification}.
