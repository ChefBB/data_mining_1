\chapter{Pattern Mining}
\label{ch:capitolo2}
The chosen pattern mining technique was Apriori. To perform this task, continuous attributes were discretized according to their distributions. 
The objective of this process was to identify bins that were both semantically meaningful and sufficiently balanced in terms of number of records per bin. 
Among all the available numerical attributes, the ones chosen for the pattern mining task are the following (with their corresponding binning):
\textbf{Aggiustare var sotto quando avremo var definitive }
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{runtimeMinutes\_TitleType}: VeryLowRT (3-30), LowRT (31-60), MediumRT (61-90), HighRT (91-170) 
    \item \texttt{numVotes}: VeryLowNV (5-15), LowNV (16-50), MediumNV (51-150), HighNV (151-997), VeryHighNV (1001-966565) 
    \item \texttt{rating}: VeryLowR (1-3), LowR (4-6), MediumR (7), HighR (8), VeryHighR (9-10)
    \item \texttt{userReviewsTotal}: NoUR (0), FewUR (1-3), ManyUR (4-30), VeryManyUR (31-5727)
    \item \texttt{totalCredits}: VeryLowC (0-15), LowC (16-35), MediumC (36-65), HighC (66-200), VeryHighC (201-15742)
    \item \texttt{criticReviewsTotal}: NoCR(0), FewCR(1), ModerateCR(2-5), ManyCR(6-20), VeryHighCR (21-45), ExtremelyHighCR (46-533)
\end{itemize}

Regarding discrete attributes, \texttt{titleType} was considered for this task but being kept as it is. 
On the other hand, for \texttt{countryOfOrigin\_[continent code]}\footnote{see subsection 1.1.3 for the list of the 7 features} it has been decided to create one variable for each continent, i.e. \texttt{from\_[continent name]}, which has been binarized into:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{not\_from\_[continent name]}: when the value of the attribute is 0
    \item \texttt{is\_from\_[continent name]}: when the value of the attribute is >= 1
\end{itemize}

The data on which this task was performed was not normalized.
