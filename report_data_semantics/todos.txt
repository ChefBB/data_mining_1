histograms following sturges' rule (maybe without outliers)
parallel coordinates (looks really useful)
data matrix
    - correlation

Checklist for Data Understanding
• Determine the quality of the data. (e.g. syntactic accuracy)
• Find outliers. (e.g. using visualization techniques)
• Detect and examine missing values. Possible hidden by default values.
• Discover new or confirm expected dependencies or correlations
between attributes.
• Check specific application dependent assumptions (e.g. the attribute
follows a normal distribution)
• Compare statistics with the expected behaviour.


“The validation of clustering structures is the most
difficult and frustrating part of cluster analysis.
Without a strong effort in this direction, cluster
analysis will remain a black art accessible only to
those true believers who have experience and great
courage.”


use k-means with higher k, unite into lower number of clusters
(originally wished for k). useful in case data is noisy, non-globular,
clusters have different shapes/densities
