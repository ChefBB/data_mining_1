Checklist for Data Understanding
• Determine the quality of the data. (e.g. syntactic accuracy)
• Find outliers. (e.g. using visualization techniques)
• Detect and examine missing values. Possible hidden by default values.
• Discover new or confirm expected dependencies or correlations
between attributes.
• Check specific application dependent assumptions (e.g. the attribute
follows a normal distribution)
• Compare statistics with the expected behaviour.
